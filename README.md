The web application enables users to easily add and find events aimed at bringing together board game enthusiasts. Following security standards for login and registration, each user has a unique profile, which they can use to search for or create events. Once an event is added or searched, it becomes visible to all users, and hosts can later edit their events. This intuitive and straightforward solution is a key reason for using the application. The API and client work seamlessly to provide fast and secure use of every part of the web application.

Brief Overview of Features:

Hosts can create events for board game gatherings, specifying location, date, and time. Players can browse available events using various filters, such as location, date, and board game type.
